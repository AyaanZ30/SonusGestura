# Project Title: SonusGestura
SonusGestura is a cutting-edge Python project that transforms how you interact with your system's volume control. By harnessing the power of computer vision and hand-tracking technologies, SonusGestura enables you to adjust the volume with simple hand gestures. Experience the future of touchless interaction with this elegant and intuitive solution.

## Description
SonusGestura is a Python project that uses hand gestures to control the volume on your computer. By using two fingers, the project can detect hand movements and adjust the volume accordingly. This project utilizes the Mediapipe and OpenCV libraries for hand tracking and volume control.

The following libraries are required to run this project:

    Python 3.x
    OpenCV (opencv-python)
    Mediapipe
    NumPy
    Time (standard library)
